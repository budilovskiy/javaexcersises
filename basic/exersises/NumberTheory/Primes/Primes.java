/**
 * Exercise (Primes): 
 * A positive integer is a prime if it is divisible by 1 and itself only.
 * Write a method called isPrime(int posInt) that takes a positive integer 
 * and returns true if the number is a prime.
 * Write a program called PrimeList that prompts the user for
 * an upper bound (a positive integer), and lists all the primes less than or
 * equal to it. Also display the percentage of prime (up to 2 decimal places).
 * The output shall look like:
 * Please enter the upper bound: 10000
 * 1 
 * 2 
 * 3 
 * ...... 
 * ...... 
 * 9967 
 * 9973 
 * [1230 primes found (12.30%)]
 * 
 * Hints: To check if a number n is a prime, the simplest way is try dividing
 * n by 2 to âˆšn.
